<p>Check out Craig Holcomb Jr's final reel from his studies at the New York Conservatory for the Dramatic Arts. 
    After learning from of some of the industries' bests, students at NYCDA put together a final reel monologue 
    that demonstrates all of the hard work and preparation that they have put in during their time at the school. 
    A professional film and set crew helped make this possible, giving the students a real sense of what its like 
    to be on the big screen.
