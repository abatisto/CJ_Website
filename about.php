<h2>About</h2>

<p id = "bio">
    
    I am a driven person. When I want something bad enough, there is nothing that will come in the way of obtaining 
    that goal. The same is true when it comes to a professional setting. I want to bring the best of me to every project 
    regardless of what that might be.

    The theatre has always been ingrained into my core ever since I saw Seussical the Musical as a child. It was a 
    jaw-dropping atmosphere that I didn’t want to escape. Since then I’ve been involved in acting, lighting design, 
    set construction, and various crew work positions to develop a better understanding of how all the different parts 
    of theatre come together for a production. In the theatrical setting I have focused on acting but also lighting 
    and set design I have worked on a number of professional shows; ranging from dance shows with 802 Fusion to a full 
    out theatrical productions with FlynnSpace.  I also have worked as a tech member/stage crew while I have grown up 
    around the arts and know every job. Most of the work I have done with theatrical lighting design was in high school. 
    I successfully lit almost every show that happened at Essex High School. Everyone knew that if they needed great 
    lighting for their show all they had to do was come to me. It was a thrill to do show after show and I kept seeking 
    the next opportunity. At one point, we brought a show to competition and I worked countless hours in the booth just 
    getting the lighting right for the day we went to the competition. It needed to be perfect for it was a bare minimum 
    set. I needed to communicate everything with just lights and a button and the occasional sound effect. I got it down 
    to the point where I had the show memorized in my head and was just another cog in the machine for the show. We 
    brought the show to competition and I programmed on this new board, this new space, in under an hour. The show was 
    a complete success and I had goose bumps seeing it all come together. That year they invented a new award that was 
    for ‘Best Lighting Design in a Production’ and I’m happy to say that I was the recipient.

     I am a recent graduate of The New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts. Studying at the location was another amazing 
     opportunity and kept instilling the mind-set to always bring the best of you to everything that you do. The 
     conservatory is a two-year intensive program and I am happy to have graduated with an Associate in Occupational 
     Studies Degree in Film & Television.

     For lighting, I studied under Jamien Lundy Forrest Lincoln Center in New York and with Vermont Stage; because of her 
     it has inspired me to work on shows of my own. I am more trained in lighting and have lit/designed theatrical, dance, 
     and comedy shows. Theatrical design is one of my favorite things to put my energy in because I make a show look as 
     incredible as it deserves to. It gets me excited and anyone who knows me knows the countless hours that I spend in a 
     lighting booth or theatre until I know the show is at its best.

     While at NYCDA, I interned on-set for the final reel which is held like a traditional film set. Working with the 
     professionals who have worked on hundreds of professional Film/TV projects made me want to be better. I was able to 
     learn all the modern day equipment and what its purpose was for being on set. I worked under the AD of the shoot and 
     was soon an assistant for the director(s). I helped make sure we were a working and efficient team.

     I recently completed a Marketing Assistant Internship with Vermont Stage, which was educational and opened my eyes to 
     Marketing. My job was to organize constituents in their database, assist with first read parties for donors, load-ins
     and strikes, and help put together a silent auction. Originally, Marketing was not even written in the original 
     description of the internship but after a few weeks I was asked if I would help and was more than eager to accept. This
     was a great opportunity as I created multiple campaigns for the season opening production and kept a presence on their 
     social media accounts. Lastly, I was then invited to be a cast member in their annual Winter Tales production as well 
     as taking on the position of the Assistant Stage Manager. I was pulled in a million directions at one point while 
     absolutely loving it the whole time.
